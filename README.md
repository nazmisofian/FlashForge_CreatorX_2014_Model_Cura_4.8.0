# FlashForge_Cura4.8.0
This repository is to keep the Gcode for Single and Dual Extruder Configurations.

The original manual is based off here https://3duniverse.org/3D%20Universe's%20Unofficial%20FlashForge%20Creator%20X%20Manual.pdf using Slic3r's example.

The Gcodes for single and dual configurations have been adjusted (only the whitespaces) so that it can be exported over to any other slicer programs

the .Json files for this flashforge creator X (2014 model presumably) was created/modified using makerbot's .Json file in Cura
